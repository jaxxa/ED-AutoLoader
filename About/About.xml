This module adds an Autoloader that can be used to supply things to some of the buildings in this mod. If a building in a module requires it, then this module will be listed as a requirement.
This is functionally identical to a Hopper in the base game, but accepts a wider variety of resources without cluttering the stock Hopper or causing incompatibilities with other mods.
