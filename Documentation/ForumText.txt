This Mod adds a building called an Autoloader that can be used to supply things to certain buildings. If a building in a mod can use it then it should be listed in the description of that mod.
This is functionally identical to a Hopper in the base game, but accepts a wider variety of resources without cluttering the stock Hopper or causing incompatibilities with other mods.

This will not do anything by itself, but is intended as a helper for other mods.
